      <h2>Hi I'm Amy</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to my website! I'm a recent Computer Science and Statistics
        graduate based in Toronto with a passion for employment. 🌸✨ <br />
        <br />
        Currently, I'm actively seeking exciting job opportunities in the tech
        industry. If you're on the lookout for a dedicated developer ready to
        embrace new challenges, let's connect. Whether it's over a cup of coffee
        ☕ or a virtual chat, I'm all ears! 🚀🤝 <br />
        <br />
        When I'm not behind a screen, you can find me exploring the outdoors on
        my bike, painting geese, or experimenting with new recipes in the
        kitchen. 🌱📚🍳 I genuinely believe in technology's ability to enhance
        our lives, and I'm enthusiastic about contributing my skills to projects
        that drive positive change. Feel free to explore more and reach out –
        I'm excited to connect! <br />
