      <h2>Hi I'm Amy</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to my website! I'm a recent Computer Science graduate located in
        Toronto with a passion for exploring the world of tech. 🌸✨ <br />
        <br />
        When I'm not behind a screen, you can find me exploring the outdoors on
        my bike, painting geese, or experimenting with new recipes in the
        kitchen. 🌱📚🍳 I believe that technology has the power to make life
        more vibrant, and I'm excited to contribute my skills to projects that
        bring positive change. <br />
        <br />
        I'm currently on the lookout for exciting job opportunities in the tech
        world. If you're seeking a dedicated developer who's ready to take on
        new challenges, let's connect. Whether it's over a cup of coffee ☕ or a
        virtual chat, I'm all ears! 🚀🤝
